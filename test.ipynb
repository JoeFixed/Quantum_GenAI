Apple today announced it is extending free access to Emergency SOS via satellite for an additional year for existing iPhone 14 users.1 Emergency SOS via satellite has helped save lives around the world. From a man who was rescued after his car plummeted over a 400-foot cliff in Los Angeles, to lost hikers found in the Apennine Mountains in Italy, we continue to hear stories of our customers being able to connect with emergency responders when they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. “We are so happy iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 users can take advantage of this groundbreaking service for two more years for free'\n",

Current tools to manage high cholesterol include exercise, diet, and statin medications. These two new drugs would be the first to go after the genetic cause of high cholesterol.
